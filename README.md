The strategic board game Othello, also known as Reversi, for Android

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi:

"Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color."

This implementation supports any combination of human or computer players.  Computer playes calculate their
moves on the device's CPU (rather than from a remote server).

This implementation is a work in progress.  Major TODOs include

* Support for resolutions other than 1080p
* Localization
